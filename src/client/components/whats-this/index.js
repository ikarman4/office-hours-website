                Follow two curious kids as they navigate and explore big, seemingly intangible questions many people
                interested in research struggle with: What differentiates prolific researchers from those around them?
                Which topics or problems are worth spending a lifetime studying? What actionable steps can I take to
                illuminate my own interests? Join us in getting to know, as well as learning from researchers who are
                deeply passionate about their work, the leaders that are tasked with solving the ever-growing number
                of problems we face today.
